# PaperClue — Grounded research workspace

Understand your research. Discover what is missing. Prepare your work for
publication — **every AI claim traced back to an inspectable source**.

## The mental model: My Research ↔ Discover

| | **My Research** (private) | **Discover** (external) |
|---|---|---|
| What | Manuscripts, uploaded PDFs, collections, university corpus, versions | Public literature via Semantic Scholar |
| Storage | Postgres + Qdrant (one collection per manuscript, one per tenant) | S2 API with a server-side TTL cache |
| Provenance color | 🟢 green (manuscript) · 🟠 amber (university) | 🔵 indigo (public) |

The bridge between the two spaces is a pair of ever-present actions:
**Add to my research** (a Discover paper joins your library) and
**Find sources for this** (select text in your PDF → contextual public search).

`source_scope` (`manuscript` / `university` / `public`) is stored in the
database, returned in every API response and every graph node/edge — never
reconstructed from a color or URL. The university corpus never leaves the
tenant; citation verification is the only place a manuscript crosses the
public corpus.

## Features

- **Upload & visible ingestion** — parse structure → extract references →
  detect metadata → *the workspace opens here* → semantic indexing continues
  in the background (batched). Until the index is ready, chat/explain fall
  back to lexical search, so a fresh upload is usable in seconds.
- **Paper Insight** — structured brief (problem, contribution, method,
  results, limitations), every claim anchored to an exact quote: click →
  the PDF scrolls and highlights the passage. Chat with your paper (SSE
  streaming, page-cited answers).
- **Living PDF** — pdf.js viewer with quote-anchored highlight layers, and
  selection → **Explain** / **Find sources**.
- **Discover** — federated grounded search with scopes
  `All / Public / University / My research` (the last one is private RAG over
  your own uploads). Two views: result list (with "why it matches") and an
  evidence synthesis whose inline `[n]` citations are clickable — every
  citation is linked to a retrieved paper, never invented.
- **Mind Maps** — first-class objects seeded from a *research question*, a
  *manuscript* or a *collection*. Nodes carry a "why this paper is here"
  explanation; edge color = provenance, edge style = relation (solid cites /
  dashed similar). Control bar: label/dot mode, provenance filters; summary
  line (papers · research families · cited · gaps). **Gap Finder**: clusters
  your manuscript cites nothing from, with inspect/add actions. Branch
  expansion via the S2 recommendations API.
- **Review** — peer-review-style issues (severity, category, anchored quote,
  suggestion, confidence) in a workflow: severity groups → issue detail →
  Accept / Edit / Dismiss. Accepting a fix records a **version** (diff kept)
  and visibly moves the readiness score. Citation verification resolves every
  reference against Semantic Scholar (✓ verified / ⚠ mismatch / ✗ not found).
- **Journal Format** — real journal profiles (*Scientific Reports — Research
  Article*, *IEEE Access — Regular Paper*): compliance checklist with
  localized details, abstract before/after, restructure plan, DOCX export.
- **Evidence Ledger** — a drawer (closed by default) aggregating every proof
  the features produce, with graded statuses (direct / partial / contextual
  support, conflict, unresolved). Clicking a proof highlights the PDF or
  opens the source paper.
- **Readiness Score, explicable** — 0 credit until the work is done:
  ingestion 15 + insight 15 + citations 30×(verified/total) + review
  40−open-issue penalties. Click the gauge for the component breakdown.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router, TS, `basePath /paperclue`) | SSR + streaming, single deployable |
| UI | Tailwind (custom tokens), lucide icons | high-contrast, no generic-AI look |
| PDF | react-pdf / pdf.js + custom highlight layer | quote-anchored, bidirectional |
| Graph | React Flow | custom nodes, radial cluster layout |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python 3.11, async) | I/O-bound pipelines, SSE |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude (Sonnet) | brief/review/synthesis/cluster labels |
| Public grounding | Semantic Scholar Graph + Recommendations API | real papers, citation graph |
| Embeddings | FastEmbed (local, `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, 384d) | free, no external dependency |
| Vector DB | Qdrant | one collection per manuscript / tenant |
| Metadata | PostgreSQL 16 | manuscripts, refs, issues, versions, maps |
| Jobs | FastAPI BackgroundTasks + in-process task registry | demo scale; poll `/tasks/{id}` |
| Hosting | Docker Compose behind the MIRROR Caddy | route `/paperclue*` → `paperclue-web:3000` |

Robustness choices for keyless Semantic Scholar: max 1 concurrent request,
1.2 s spacing, 9 s timeout, bounded retries, in-memory TTL cache (searches
24 h, metadata/recommendations 7 days), partial results with a visible
warning instead of a blocked screen.

## Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (S2_API_KEY optional but recommended)
docker compose up -d --build
# → web on :3000 under basePath /paperclue, api on :8000
```

The `web` container also joins the external `mirror_default` network so the
MIRROR Caddy can reverse-proxy it. Without that stack:
`docker network create mirror_default`.

Note: the Caddyfile is bind-mounted as a single file — after editing it,
`docker restart mirror-caddy` (an in-container reload still sees the old inode).

## Demo script (7 minutes)

1. **Home** — three actions; the animated mini-map explains the product.
2. **Discover** — ask a literature question; provenance badges, synthesis with
   clickable citations; *Add to my research*; *Create map from this search*.
3. **Mind map** — clusters, why-connected nodes, provenance toggles; open a
   paper, expand a branch.
4. **Upload the manuscript** — visible pipeline, workspace opens immediately
   (readiness 15), indexing badge in the header.
5. **Paper Insight** — click a claim → the PDF highlights the quote; ask the
   chat "what is the contribution?" (readiness → 30).
6. **Review** — verify citations (→ ~58), run review, open an issue, accept a
   fix → version recorded, gauge moves; click the gauge for the breakdown.
7. **Journal** — IEEE Access checklist, restructure plan, export DOCX.
